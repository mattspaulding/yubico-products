## Tech

Since the project is a product catalog, I want to ensure the pages load as fast as possible and are SEO friendly. Using a static page approach is a great solution, this is why I chose Next.js as the framework. 

- All pages are statically generated.
- Static pages are edge cached for optimal speed.
- Images are served in WebP format.
- Links are prefetched for instant navigation.
- Code splitting so each page only loads what is necessary for that page.
